            <p>Construction starts with a unit square. First step: paint<br>
            a 1/2 square in the center with white. Then you need to<br>
            mentally divide the square into 4 identical squares and<br>
            paint a square with a side of 1/4 in the center of each<br>
            of them. Further, each of these 4 squares will again<br>
            turn out into 4 parts, a total of 16 squares, and with<br>
             each of them you need to do the same. Etc.</p>

             equal. Then, to each of the 4 ends of the figure, a copy<br>
             is drawn, reduced in half. To each end (there are<br>
             already 16 of them) a copy of the letter H is added,<br>
             already reduced by 4 times. Etc. In the limit, a fractal<br>
             will turn out, which visually almost fills a certain<br>
            square.</p>

          <p>The fractal dimension of the part painted in white in<br>
          the end is equal to log24 = 2. It is everywhere dense in<br>
          the original square. This means that no matter what<br>
          point of the square we take, in any, no matter how<br>
          small, its neighborhood there will be filled points. That<br>
          is, as a result, almost everything became white - the<br>
          area of the remainder is equal to 0, and the fractal<br>
          occupies an area of 1. But the length of the border of<br>

          <p>The H-fractal is dense everywhere in it. That is, in any<br>
           neighborhood of any point of the square, there are<br>
           fractal points. Very similar to what happens with the<br>
           T-square. This is not accidental, because if you look<br>
           closely, you can see that each letter H is contained<br>
           in its own small square, which was completed<br>
           at the same step. We can say that the H-fractal<br>
           fills its own square (space-filling curve).<br>
           Therefore, its fractal dimension is 2.</p>

            <p>The RGB color model is an additive color model in<br>

             are added together in various ways to reproduce a<br>
             broad array of colors. The name of the model comes<br>
             from the initials of the three additive primary colors,<br>
             red, green, and blue.The color is encoded by the<br>
             gradations of the component channels. As the<br>

             its intensity increases during synthesis.<br>

             RGB is a device-dependent color model: different<br>
             devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value<br>
             differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors<br>
             or dyes) and their response to the individual red, green,<br>
             and blue levels vary from manufacturer to<br>
             manufacturer, or even in the same device over time.<br>
             Thus an RGB value does not define the same color<br>

             perceives color-generating attributes. In these models,<br>
             the colors of each shade are arranged in a radial cut<br>
             around the central axis of neutral colors, which ranges<br>
             from black at the bottom to white at the top.<br>

          <div class="infoText">
            <p>An affine transformation is any transformation that preserves collinearity (i.e., all points lying
             on a line initially still lie on the line after transformation) and distance ratios (for example, the
             midpoint of a line segment remains the midpoint after transformation). In this sense, affinity
             indicates a special class of projective transformations that do not move any objects from the
             affine space R ^ 3 to the plane at infinity or vice versa. Affine transformation is also called affinity.
             <br><br>
             Geometric contraction, expansion, expansion, reflection, rotation, shear, similarity transformations, spiral
             similarity and translation are all affine transformations, as well as their combinations. In general, an affine
             transform is a combination of rotations, translations, stretches, and translations.
             <br><br>
             Although the affine transform preserves the aspect ratio of the lines, it does not necessarily preserve the
             angles or length. Any triangle can be transformed into any other using an affine transformation, therefore all
             triangles are affine and in this sense are affine generalizations of congruent and similar ones.
             <br><br>
             A particular example of combining rotation and expansion is the rotation-enlargement transformation.</p>
